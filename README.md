# Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) Python Project

A Python implementation of Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) featuring an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Project Description

This project simulates a game of Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) with a command-line interface. It includes an AI engine capable of making strategic decisions using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimization. The game supports saving/loading states, move validation, and board visualization with ANSI-colored pieces.
